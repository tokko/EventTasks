Manage todo-lists centered around an event. For instance you could have an event called "Go to cabin" with tasks you have to perform at home before leaving e.g. "Pack shirts", "Pack underwear", "Take out the trash", "Find car keys".
Start an event by selecting it from the list. When finished, the event will remain for the next time.
